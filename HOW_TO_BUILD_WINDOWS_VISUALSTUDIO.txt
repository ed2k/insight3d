Terms
-----

- "application directory" is the directory with the executable file insight3d.exe
- "project directory" is the directory with the source files (main.cpp, application.h, etc.) 

List of DLLs
------------

The following dlls need to be either copied to the application directory or located where the system can find them (e.g., a location listed in the PATH variable): 

- the opencv dll files
- SDL dll files 
- pthreadVC2.dll
- shared version x64 of the LAPACK and BLAS libraries, can be downloaded from this website http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvobod2/misc/lapack/ (as of October, 2016)

How to build under Windows
--------------------------

The following libraries are necessary for building in Microsoft Visual Studio: 

	- opencv
	- opengl
	- opensift
	- SDL
	- lapack and blas 
	- pthreads

The OpenCV_Debug.props file inside the project directory contains relevant compiler and linker configuration. It expects that the OpenCV library can be found using the %(OPENCV_DIR) system variable and that the remaining libraries are inside the project directory.
